# Double Slit Diffraction 
### version 0.0.1

*Scroll down for double slit intensity pattern plot. Adjust plot parameters on left.* 

The intensity pattern of a double slit experiment is a combination of the single and double slit interfernce pattern. The figure below plots the double slit intensity pattern-solid red line . The dashed yellow plots the single slit interfence pattern. The solid orange line plots the double slit interference pattern. The double slit intensity pattern (solid red) is formed by modulating the double slit intensity (orange) with the single slit diffraction (dashed yellow).

The single slit interference pattern is described by $D \sin \theta = m \lambda$, $m=\pm 1, \pm 2, ...$, a condition for minima, where $D$ is the slit width. 

The double slit interference pattern is described by $d \sin \theta = m \lambda$, $m= 0, \pm 1, \pm 2, ...$, a condition for maxima, where $d$ is the spacing between slits.
